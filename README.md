## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Apple Maps:

Switch Up Your Route: Easy to swap the start and end points to check travel times in both directions. Just drag point Y over point X, and you've got the time.
Fav places: With your favorite places, you can get to them quicker without the typing it every time.

Instagram:
Story Views: shows you exactly who's been watching/stalking your story.
Discover Page: It's so addictiv and in my opinion, it's better than youtube and pinterest algorithm (but TikTok is the better than instagram).
Muting: mute users without unfollowing or blocking them. Their stories, messages, and posts and they'll never know!

iMessage:
Recently deleted: recover what your deleted messages.
Memoji: using memoji to chat (tho I don't use it frequently, I love the idea)

## Notes

I did the connection changeBackgroundColor connection twice so I got help from Slack channel and changed it.
